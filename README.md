This project is my personal website.  I built the site using HTML and CSS.  In addition to basic styling, I used CSS to add some fun animations and media queries to rearrange content at various browser dimensions. 

The site is hosted on heroku and is available at [billbittner.info](http://www.billbittner.info).  Check it out!
